Anyone can propose a Bytesize Session. The sessions should feel like they belong to the team.  

Although a host is not mandatory, it can be useful, especially at the start.  The role of the host is to be an enabler, someone that keeps the timing of the session and focuses the discussion on the goal.  The host can be anyone, not necessarily someone leading the team. The host should change from time to time.
