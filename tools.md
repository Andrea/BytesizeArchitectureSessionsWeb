What are good tools to use with Bytesize Architecture Sessions?


## During a session

During a session use any collaborative board all the participants of a sessions can **easily** access. 

If you are working in person 

* Use paper and markers for [Alone Together]() 
* A whiteboard is really nice for [Consensus] 
* sticky notes to comments while you work can be very useful

Take pictures of final result.

If you are working online, anything that would enable everyone that should take part to change the diagram at the same time is good. A popular option at the moment is Miro, but the best is to use tools that participants are already familiar with. 
If you are working on Miro, having multiple sessions in one board can be a really nice way to see progression and note diagrams that need updating.


## After a session

Once the collaboration session finishes, it is recommended to convert the diagram to a clean version that is easy to read. At minimum a diagram should have: a title, the type of diagram and a legend section. Adding date and scope of the diagram and a brief description can be useful too.

When you have just one or two diagrams it's probably best to not worry too much about where to store it, but it's a good time to observe how people interact with the diagram. Making the decision of how to manage these diagrams will dictate how they will be used, and it's extremely context dependent. 

Answering these questions might help finding the best option

* What kind of diagrams are you making?  

Consider who would have access to update the diagrams or models, these are live documents.

* What tooling do you need to generate them. 

If you are using C4 [PlantUml](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML), [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) and [IcePanel](https://icepanel.io/) are popular options. Please visit tools section of the [the c4 model website](https://c4model.com/tooling) too for a more comprehensive review of the tools. 
Some of these tools would enable you to navigate and update the model as you are there but you might need to ensure access and payment for that access.

These is where your context is important, access to the tools and capability to edit the diagrams is what will dictate how often these documents are updated, and you want to encourage updates inline with changes to the system they represent.

* If you generate diagrams rather than create navigable models, How to easily find them?

This question also depends on how your organisation works. The principle to apply here is to focus on access to view and edit for as many of the people creating the diagrams.

If everyone document things in a collaboration website such as WikiPages, Confluence, Notion, etc you probably want to be able to easily see your diagrams there. If you need code to generate to diagrams, ideally it should be in the codebase that the diagrams model.
