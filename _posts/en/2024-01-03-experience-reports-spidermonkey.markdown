[SpiderMonkey Byte-Sized Architectures](https://spidermonkey.dev/blog/2023/11/16/spidermonkey-byte-sized-architectures.html) [by Daniel Minor] 
Daniel gave a talk in Tokyo as part of JSConf/TC39 where he described how the team he is part of uses Bytesize Architecture Sessions.

I really enjoyed his talk and the section on Bytesize Architecture Sessions. It's always great to see how other people use it. 

If you are using Bytesize in your team please reach out and we can add a case study to this site!
