![Overview]({{site.url}}/images/bytesize-infographic.png)

Bytesize Architecture Sessions are a workshop format that helps teams understand the systems they work on. Each session focuses on a small üçï slice of a system. After some sessions your team will become more homogeneous in the understanding of their systems, grow a consistent vocabulary and ultimately build tools to design the future together.

A  session lasts between 45 and 90 minutes ‚è≤Ô∏è, and has four well defined parts: Session Goal, Alone Together, Consensus and Summary. You can model your systems using different tools. I suggest starting with [C4 Diagrams](https://c4model.com/).
